# Teorema-de-Tales-Basico
### [DOES NOT ACCEPT EXPRESSIONS AS SEGMENT LENGTHS] - Tales Theorem Solver

### ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNINGS
‚òëÔ∏è This is a basic Python program designed to solve the Tales Theorem in its basic cases, which are:  

‚Ä¢ Only one "x" value;  

‚Ä¢ Only one segment without a value (In this case, the program asks the user for the total length of the parallel segment);  

‚Ä¢ Does not accept expressions as segment values (Example: x + 2 or 10 + 5), only integers and decimal numbers;  

### üë®‚Äçüíª STRUCTURE
‚Ä¢ The program is divided into 3 main files:  

‚Ä¢ 2 modules named **"analises"** and **"estrutura"** <- These are imported into the file called **"programa_principal.py"**;  

  ‚û• **analises:** Responsible for categorizing the types of data entered by the user to adapt them for solving the theorem.  
  
  ‚û• **estrutura:** Responsible for displaying the problem and its solution to the user *[DISPLAY MADE THROUGH THE TERMINAL]*  

‚Ä¢ 1 file called **"programa_principal.py"** which **is where the program should be executed**, as it uses the 2 modules mentioned above to run the program.  

### ‚ûï ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
‚Ä¢ All module functions include *docstrings*;  

‚Ä¢ You can also find **annotations** within the code to help anyone reading the program understand it better.  

### üö® NOTES
‚Ä¢ This is my **first project** involving programming.  

  ‚û• Therefore, it is likely that there are errors or "bad practices" within the program, so **feel free to give me advice**!
